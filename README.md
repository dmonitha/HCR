Mini project done at G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology & Sciences (2021)

# Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) with Flask

## Overview
This project involves a **Flask web application** that uses a pre-trained **Keras model** for **handwritten character recognition**. The application detects **alphabets (A-Z)** and **numbers (1-9)** from uploaded handwritten images.

## Features
- **Real-time Prediction**: Upload an image, and the system will predict the handwritten character.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A simple web interface to interact with the system.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes a Keras model trained on handwritten characters for accurate predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Required libraries**:
  - `Flask`
  - `TensorFlow`
  - `Keras`
  - `NumPy`
  - `OpenCV`
