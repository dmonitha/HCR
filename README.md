Handwritten Character Recognition
Overview
This project focuses on developing a Handwritten Character Recognition system capable of detecting both alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (1-9). The system utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to train a model that can accurately recognize characters from handwritten input.

The recognition system is built using Python, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and others for preprocessing, training, and prediction tasks.

Features
Character Detection: Recognizes uppercase alphabets (A-Z) and digits (1-9) from handwritten inputs.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for drawing characters and receiving predictions in real time.
Accuracy: The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten characters to achieve reliable recognition.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, etc.


Model Details
Architecture: The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently recognize patterns in handwritten characters.
Training Data: The model is trained using a dataset of labeled handwritten characters. The dataset includes both alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (1-9).
Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy and robustness.
