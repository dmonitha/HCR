# Handwritten Character Recognition

Mini project done at G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology & Sciences (2021)

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Handwritten Character Recognition** system that can detect **alphabets** (A-Z) and **numbers** (1-9) from handwritten input. The system uses machine learning techniques such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to achieve accurate recognition.

## Features
- **Character Detection**: Recognizes uppercase alphabets (A-Z) and digits (1-10) from handwritten input.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows drawing characters and receiving real-time predictions.
- **Accuracy**: The model is trained to provide reliable recognition with high accuracy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Required libraries**:
  - `TensorFlow`
  - `Keras`
  - `NumPy`
  - `OpenCV`
  - `Matplotlib`
